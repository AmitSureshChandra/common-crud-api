Implementing common feature controller

- With just implementing `IBaseCRUDController` you can get by default CRUD api
- If you don't want Delete Api then You can implement `IBaseCRUController`
- With implementing `IBaseStatusController` you will get status enable/disable api by default
- If you want your implementation then you can override default impletation
- check `example` folder to see sample

I am open for suggestions, kindly help me to make it more better.
